# Istusave
Repository for Istusave: A Mobile Android Finance Tracker Application.

Istusave is an app I developed with two other friends as both a personal project and a school project. It is an offline-first mobile app developed for Android OS devices. This project
introduced me to Kotlin, Android Studio, and mobile application development in general. I learned a lot from my time coding and designing the functionality of this app. And we, the devs,
hope to make more out of Istusave.

My contribution to this project was primarily in back-end development, as well as in the construction of the application's database.

Programming Language/s used: Kotlin
Database used: RoomDB
Tools used: Android Studio
